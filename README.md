# Basic unit propogation checker

Name - Basic Unit Propogation one-run checker

This can be run using a cat command: cat CNF_file.cnf | python ad_DPLL.py

This was a heavily rushed solver which was initially meant to be CDCL-based but I wasn't able to finish it in time and was only able to validate the initial clause-optimization via unit propogations. It works for extremely simple propositions but is unlikely to work on anything larger unless the answer is a set of 1s. It is technically complete nonetheless.

Evaluation directories are present in the main branch and labeled as such

I do not consent to having this solver, its code, or my name being made visible on the Blackboard course page.
